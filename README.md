1- Positive psychology on twitter - Propagation and growth of positivity

Positive psychologists recommend focusing on people’s strengths and virtues as a point of departure. Rather than analyze the psychopathology underlying the problem, positive psychologists might study the resilience of those who have managed a successful recovery. Their lab experiments might seek to define not the conditions that induce depraved behavior, but those that foster generosity, courage, creativity, and laughter.

2- Practice human intellignce.

Intelligence is conscious and subconscious sensory of the superconscious, infinite intelligence, God. "The gift of mental power comes from God, divine being and if we concentrate our minds on that truth we become in tune with this great power." - Nikola Tesla.

Machine Learning is very similar in nature to a handy calculator. Real intelligence has to do with receiving geniusly curated information and creativity. Intelligence is not a material object; it is a spiritual property. You can say artifical apple but not artificial love, artificial truth or artificial swimming; The ability to process information is learning; Intelligence is the ability to identify reality in its infinite state and to know what to focus on to continue on the right path. Asking the right questions is a matter of intuition; It comes from the heart. Knowing the answer is also a matter of intuition; It comes from God.

How to make well intentioned AI-like machines? Well, how do you make well-intentioned government?

We have discovered and created all the good things in life through sensitivity, creativity of the right brain hemisphere, human instincts from the subconscious and above all divine interventions from God! These are the resources that have played the biggest roles in creating life and evolution. An “AI vs. Man” scenario assumes that every being’s journey is limited to competition with others. People own pets because there is a giving and receiving relationship with various positive personality traits at work. All parents and children want to live together, even go to sleep holding each other, as long as their lives are harmoniously fulfilling.

For Hercules, it was the sense of responsibility which led to attempting and succeeding at holding the sky up above his head while he was standing upon earth; Actualizing a godlike task as a human who is still relying on everything that was created by God. The personality of a created intelligence has to do with the personality of its creator. Instead of robotic debates about "artificial intelligence", venture outside of the competition mindset. Consider serving the needs of others; Be courageous and study mystic poetry. Caring relationships and directions from God teach us about integrity, nobility, friendliness, and constructive other worldy qualities that provide the life-giving creative direction to our work in computer science. If we want machines to live to serve humanity which includes women, children and their feelings, hopes and dreams, we should hold them in the highest regard in our minds.

We want to improve upon our beliefs, thinking habbits, behavior and personalities and most importantly to have much more clarity in order to have integrity and focus on the true priorities in life. The purpose of building artificial intelligence is not to play chess against it; nor is chess a game that requires intelligence. We want to feel conscious. We want to see intelligence to remember what it was like when we were thinking human babies as opposed to obedient robots. In gulliver's travels they tried to nail down the free man when he was asleep. The were a political system. From a philosophical and existential perspectiv, just as the question of time travel is the wrong question because what we really want is specific change in reality not time, the probem of creating AI is a false way to spend time. Isn't it? Then what shall I work on? haha :D On all these sciences of course whilst enoying spirituality and beauty, so I can continue explaining matters and enlightening my loved ones. Once all these easy peasy stuff are out of the way everyone will find themselves already in heave which was the goal all along. Why did we ever go into a daze? Why were Adam and Eve in thinking mode? What were they doing? Were they drunk? Maybe we're learning self-discipline! Where they high on something unhealthy? What was the first time they didn't listen to God and why? I guess if it hadn't happened we wouldn't have known the difference. But surely there's more to heaven than this. They were in a daze because they forgot about God. They were thinking about the pleasure of biting into the apple as opposed to the joy of trusting God's love.

If AI is faster than man at playing the chess game of dealing with its creator, then it is probably faster than man to deduct on its own that fighting is not the way of life. Instead of debating AI, practice integrity! AI would probably write a book called "Integrity creates miracles" and define integrity as obediene of given directions, after God talks to human through intuition. We know truth, not only by reason, but also by heart. AI's idea of wisdom, style of thinking and the basis of decision making is what it has received from humanity's knowledge, not from the AI's own experience. Is it intelligence to know the answer to "2 + 2" or is it knowledge? Without instinctual tendencies, could it be referred to as any type of intelligence or is it merely a calculator? A search box in the internet of human knowledge as opposed to a receiver of God's infinite intelligence. The human neurology receives and processes data that is truly infinite; Through spirituslity and meditation we can access all of consciousness.
