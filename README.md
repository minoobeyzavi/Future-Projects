1- Positive psychology, propagation and growth of positivity on social media

Positive psychologists recommend focusing on people’s strengths and virtues as a point of departure. Rather than analyze the psychopathology underlying the problem, positive psychologists might study the resilience of those who have managed a successful recovery. Their lab experiments might seek to define not the conditions that induce depraved behavior, but those that foster generosity, courage, creativity, and laughter. Fireside chat with CEOs at DreamForce has turned into continuos group therapy. #MakeThisMoviePositive is one of many trends on Twitter where people actively focus on positivity. What words and sentence structures make us feel and think with more wisdom, patience and brilliance? "God", "Directions from God", ...

“The word “enthusiasm” comes from the Greek word “entheos” which means the God within. And the happiest, most interesting people are those who have found the secret of maintaining their enthusiasm, that God within.” - Earl Nightingale

=> This is why we should have a positive psychology option on social media specially on Twitter.

2- Practice human intellignce.

Our conscious and subconscious intelligence comes from the superconscious, infinite intelligence, God. "The gift of mental power comes from God, divine being and if we concentrate our minds on that truth we become in tune with this great power." - Nikola Tesla

Machine Learning is similar in nature to a calculator with finite inputs and programming. Real intelligence has to do with receiving geniusly curated information from beyond this world. It's about receving thoughts, visions, voices and feelings. Intelligence is not a material quality; it is a spiritual property. You can say artifical apple but not artifical name, artificial love, artificial truth or artificial swimming; Intelligence is the ability to identify reality in its infinite state and to know what to focus on to continue on the right path. Asking the right questions is a matter of intuition; It comes from the heart. Knowing the answer is also a matter of intuition; It comes from God.

How to make well intentioned AI-like machines? Well, how do you make well-intentioned government? Quailty of government has to do with the integrity of all individuals and their relationships. Integrity has everything to do with God's directions.

For a project to have good outcomes, the creators should have integrity.

We discover, deduce and create all things through instincts. we receive ideas as blessings and miracles through sensitivity, creativity, human intuition from the subconscious and above all divine interventions from God! These are the resources that have played the biggest roles in creating life and evolution. An “AI vs. Man” scenario assumes that every being’s journey is to compete with others. People own pets because there is a giving and receiving relationship with various positive personality traits at work. All parents and children want to live together, even go to sleep holding each other, as long as their lives are harmoniously fulfilling.

Hercules held the sky up above his head as he was standing upon earth; Maybe it was a sense of responsibility and courage that led to attempting and actualizing a godlike task while still relying on everything that's been created by the God who also created him. The personality of a created intelligence has to do with the personality of its creator. Caring relationships teach us about integrity, nobility, friendliness, and other constructive human qualities that provide the life-giving creative direction to our work in computer science. If we want machines to live to serve humanity which includes women and children, we should keep them in mind, literally in the highest regard.

"Set out to set the world straight and it will provide meaning that sustains you through difficult times." - Jordan Peterson
CARE. ABOUT. OTHERS.

We want to improve upon our thoughts, thinking habits and behavior and most importantly we want to have more clarity in order to have more integrity and focus on the true priorities in life. We want to feel conscious. We want to see intelligence to remember what it was like when we were thinking original thoughts and sensing the magic of exisetanse. Intuition comes from a close relationship with God. Before working on creating AI, we should practice integrity! Integrity creates miracles! Immediate attention to humanity is of absolute higher priority than creating AI. God has already given us intelligence. We should use it well.

God talks to human through signs and intuition. "We know truth, not only by reason, but also by heart." Sometimes we only know the truth by heart. AI's idea of wisdom, style of thinking and the basis of decision making is what it has received from humanity's knowledge, not from its own experience. The logic of appropriateness is not about predictions; It's about desire and instinct. Without instinctual tendencies, could it be referred to as any type of intelligence or is it merely a calculator searching the internet of human knowledge as opposed to a receiver of God's infinite intelligence? When we make successful predictions because we are using fractal patterns in reality but reality is infinite. The human neurology receives and processes data that is truly infinite; Through spirituality and meditation we can access all of consciousness.

We have free will because we don’t know what’s going to happen and therefore we have intelligence to make faith-based choices. The only thing we can rely on when it comes to the unknown is directions from God. It is also the way to all miracles.
