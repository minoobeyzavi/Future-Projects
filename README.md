1- Positive psychology, propagation and growth of positivity on social media

Positive psychologists recommend focusing on people’s strengths and virtues as a point of departure. Rather than analyze the psychopathology underlying the problem, positive psychologists might study the resilience of those who have managed a successful recovery. Their lab experiments might seek to define not the conditions that induce depraved behavior, but those that foster generosity, courage, creativity, and laughter. Fireside chat with CEOs at DreamForce has turned into continuos group therapy. #MakeThisMoviePositive is one of many trends on Twitter where people actively focus on positivity. What words and sentence structures make us feel and think with more wisdom, patience and brilliance? "God", "Directions from God", ...

"To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded." - Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 - 1882) American Essayist & Poet

“The word “enthusiasm” comes from the Greek word “entheos” which means the God within. And the happiest, most interesting people are those who have found the secret of maintaining their enthusiasm, that God within.” - Earl Nightingale

=> This is why we should have a positive psychology option on social media specially on Twitter.

2- Practice human intellignce.

Our conscious and subconscious intelligence comes from the superconscious, infinite intelligence, God. "The gift of mental power comes from God, divine being and if we concentrate our minds on that truth we become in tune with this great power." - Nikola Tesla

Machine Learning is similar in nature to a calculator with finite inputs and programming. Real intelligence has to do with receiving geniusly curated information from beyond this world. It's about pre-programmed instincts as well as receving new visions. Intelligence is not a material quality; it is a spiritual property. You can say artifical apple but not artifical name, artificial love, artificial truth or artificial swimming; Intelligence is the ability to identify reality in its infinite state and to know what to focus on to continue on the right path. Asking the right questions is a matter of intuition; It comes from the heart. Knowing the answer is also a matter of intuition; It comes from God.

How to make well intentioned AI-like machines? Well, how do you make well-intentioned government? Quailty of government has to do with the integrity of all individuals and their relationships, designed only by God, and integrity has everything to do with God's directions.

For the project of creating AI-like machines to have good outcomes, the creators should have integrity.

We discover, deduce and create all things through instincts. we receive ideas as blessings and miracles through sensitivity, creativity, human intuition from the subconscious and above all divine interventions from God! These are the resources that have played the biggest roles in creating life and evolution. An “AI vs. Man” scenario assumes that every being’s journey is to compete with others. People own pets because there is a giving and receiving relationship with various positive personality traits at work. All parents and children want to live together, even go to sleep holding each other, as long as their lives are harmoniously fulfilling.

Hercules held the sky up above his head as he was standing upon earth; Maybe it was a sense of responsibility and courage that led to attempting and actualizing a godlike task while he was still relying on everything that was created by the God who created him. The personality of a created intelligence has to do with the personality of its creator. Instead of robotically debating AI, venture outside of the competition mindset. Consider serving the needs of others; Be courageous; Study mystic poetry. Caring relationships and directions from God teach us about integrity, nobility, friendliness, and other constructive human qualities that provide the life-giving creative direction to our work in computer science. If we want machines to live to serve humanity which includes women, children and their feelings, hopes and dreams, we should keep them in mind, literally in the highest regard.

Set out to set the world straight and it will provide meaning that sustains us through difficult times. It will probably also provide insights and clarity in complex matters. CARE. ABOUT. OTHERS.

We want to improve upon our thoughts, thinking habits and behavior and most importantly we want to have much more clarity in order to have integrity and focus on the true priorities in life. We want to feel conscious. We want to see intelligence to remember what it was like when we were thinking original thoughts and sensing the magic of exisetanse. In Gulliver's Travels they tried to nail down the free man when he was asleep. They were a political system. From a philosophical and existential perspective, just as the question of time travel is the wrong question because what we really want is a specific experience, debating around AI is a false way to spend time. Once doubts are out of the way everyone will find themselves already in heaven which was the goal all along. For life to happen there needs to be movement and for movemet there needs to be two positions. Surely there's more to heaven than this. We should remember everything is from God. Intuition comes from a close relationship with God. Instead of debating AI, we should practice integrity! Integrity creates miracles! Immediate attention to humanity is of absolute higher priority than creating AI. Loving and giving to other human beings is the real grnius subject to be discussed, are the real genius subject to be discussed; God has already given us intelligence! We should use it well!

God talks to human through signs and intuition. "We know truth, not only by reason, but also by heart." A lot of times we only know the truth by heart, and we really know it! AI's idea of wisdom, style of thinking and the basis of decision making is what it has received from humanity's knowledge, not from its own experience. Think about the logic of appropriateness. Without instinctual tendencies, could it be referred to as any type of intelligence or is it merely a calculator? A search box in the internet of human knowledge as opposed to a receiver of God's infinite intelligence. We can make successful predictions because there are fractal patterns in reality but reality is infinite. The human neurology receives and processes data that is truly infinite; Through spirituality and meditation we can access all of consciousness.
