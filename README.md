1- Positive psychology on twitter - Propagation and growth of positivity

Positive psychologists recommend focusing on people’s strengths and virtues as a point of departure. Rather than analyze the psychopathology underlying the problem, positive psychologists might study the resilience of those who have managed a successful recovery. Their lab experiments might seek to define not the conditions that induce depraved behavior, but those that foster generosity, courage, creativity, and laughter. Fireside chat with CEOs at DreamForce has turned into continuos group therapy. #MakeThisMoviePositive is one of many trends on Twitter where people actively focus on positivity.

2- Practice human intellignce.

Intelligence is conscious and subconscious sensory of the superconscious, infinite intelligence, God. "The gift of mental power comes from God, divine being and if we concentrate our minds on that truth we become in tune with this great power." - Nikola Tesla

Machine Learning is similar in nature to a calculator. Real intelligence has to do with receiving geniusly curated information from beyond this world. It's about receving visions. Intelligence is not a material quality; it is a spiritual property. It is an ability. You can say artifical apple but not artifical name, artificial love, artificial truth or artificial swimming; The ability to process information is learning; Intelligence is the ability to identify reality in its infinite state and to know what to focus on to continue on the right path. Asking the right questions is a matter of intuition; It comes from the heart. Knowing the answer is also a matter of intuition; It comes from God.

How to make well intentioned AI-like machines? Well, how do you make well-intentioned government? Quailty of governmentn has to do with integrity and relationships.

We have discovered all the good things in life through instincts. we receive ideas as blessings and miracles through sensitivity, creativity of the right brain hemisphere, human instuition from the subconscious and above all divine interventions from God! These are the resources that have played the biggest roles in creating life and evolution. An “AI vs. Man” scenario assumes that every being’s journey is to compete with others. People own pets because there is a giving and receiving relationship with various positive personality traits at work. All parents and children want to live together, even go to sleep holding each other, as long as their lives are harmoniously fulfilling.

For Hercules, it was the sense of responsibility which led to attempting and succeeding at holding the sky up above his head while he was standing upon earth; Actualizing a godlike task as a human who is still relying on everything that was created by God. The personality of a created intelligence has to do with the personality of its creator. Instead of robotic debates about "artificial intelligence", venture outside of the competition mindset. Consider serving the needs of others; Be courageous; Study mystic poetry. Caring relationships and directions from God teach us about integrity, nobility, friendliness, and other constructive human qualities that provide the life-giving creative direction to our work in computer science. If we want machines to live to serve humanity which includes women, children and their feelings, hopes and dreams, we should keep them in mind, literally in the highest regard.

We want to improve upon our thoughts, thinking habits and behavior and most importantly we want to have much more clarity in order to have integrity and focus on the true priorities in life. The purpose of building artificial intelligence is not to play chess against it; nor is chess a game that requires intelligence. We want to feel conscious. We want to see intelligence to remember what it was like when we were thinking original thoughts and sensing the magic of exisetanse. In Gulliver's Travels they tried to nail down the free man when he was asleep. They were a political system. From a philosophical and existential perspective, just as the question of time travel is the wrong question because what we really want is a specific experience, debating around AI is a false way to spend time. Once doubts are out of the way everyone will find themselves already in heaven which was the goal all along. For life to happen there needs to be movement and for movemet there needs to be two positions. Surely there's more to heaven than this. We should remember everything is from God. Intuition comes from a close relationship with God. God wants us to grow. Immediate attention to humanity is of absolute higher priority than creating AI. Redistribution of food and other necessities of human life, are the real genius subject to be discussed.

AI is probably able to deduct on its own that collaboration is the way of life. Instead of debating AI, we should practice integrity! AI would probably write a book called "Integrity creates miracles" and define integrity as obediene of directions from God. AI might start quoting the bible. God talks to human through signs and intuition. We know truth, not only by reason, but also by heart. AI's idea of wisdom, style of thinking and the basis of decision making is what it has received from humanity's knowledge, not from the AI's own experience. Is it intelligence to know the answer to a calculation involving finite inputs or is it knowledge? Is it intelligence to understand calculation without having any exciting reason to use it? Without instinctual tendencies, could it be referred to as any type of intelligence or is it merely a calculator? A search box in the internet of human knowledge as opposed to a receiver of God's infinite intelligence. The human neurology receives and processes data that is truly infinite; Through spirituality and meditation we can access all of consciousness.

15- Can autocorrect or text prediction have access to pop culture phrases or all of existing text? Might as well be all thoughts so just improve dictation. > Make it easier to give commands to the computer as opposed to having it guess what we want or just making random interesting suggestions. Is what their doing now a combination of both?
