1- Positive psychology on twitter

The new tack of positive psychologists recommends focusing on people’s strengths and virtues as a point of departure. Rather than analyze the psychopathology underlying the problem, for example, positive psychologists might study the resilience of those who have managed a successful recovery. Their lab experiments might seek to define not the conditions that induce depraved behavior, but those that foster generosity, courage, creativity, and laughter.

2- Practice human intellignce.

Intelligence is conscious and subconscious sensory of the superconscious, infinite intelligence, God. "The gift of mental power comes from God, divine being and if we concentrate our minds on that truth we become in tune with this great power." - Nikola Tesla.

AI is a more complex version of a calculator. Intelligence has to do with receiving geniusly curated information and creativity. You can say artifical apple but not artificial love, artificial truth or artificial swimming; Intelligence is not a material object; it is a spiritual property. The ability to process information is learning; Intelligence is the ability to identify reality in its infinite state and to know what to focus on to continue on the right path. Asking the right questions is a matter of intuition; It comes from the heart, from God.

3- How to make well intentioned AI-like machines:

The same way we have created other good things; Through human instincts, creativity of the right brain hemisphere, the subconscious, divine interventions and femininity! These are the resources that have played the biggest roles in creating life and evolution. An “AI vs. Man” scenario assumes that every being’s journey is limited to competition with others. People own pets because there is a giving and receiving relationship with various positive personality traits at work. All parents and children want to live together, even go to sleep holding each other, as long as their lives are harmoniously fulfilling. And above all it was Hercules’ humility and sense of responsibility which led him to attempting and succeeding at holding up the sky above his head while he was standing upon earth; Actualizing a Godly task as a human who is still relying on everything that was created by God. The personality of a created intelligence has to do with the personality of its creator. How about instead of repetitive robotic debates about "artificial intelligence", you venture outside of the competition mindset. Consider serving the needs of other important creatures and reading mystic poetry. Caring relationships and directions from God teach us about integrity, nobility, friendliness, and constructive other worldy qualities that provide the life-giving creative direction to our work in computer science. If we want machines to live to serve humanity which includes women, children and their feelings, hopes and dreams, we should hold them in the highest regard in our minds.

The key is probably the power of human emotion!

4- Creating AI:

People want to improve their own thinking habbits, behavior and personalities and to have much more clarity and integrity in order to properly focus on actual priorities in life. The purpose of building artificial intelligence is not to play chess against it; nor is chess a game that requires intelligence. If AI is faster than man at playing the chess game of dealing with its creator, then it is probably faster than man to deduct on its own that fighting is not the way of life. Instead of debating AI, practice integrity! AI would probably write a book called "Integrity creates miracles" and define integrity as obediene of given directions, after God talks to human through intuition. We know truth, not only by reason, but also by heart. AI's idea of wisdom, style of thinking and the basis of decision making is what it has received from humanity's intelligence, not from the AI's own experience. Without instinctual tendencies, could it be referred to as any type of intelligence or is it merely a calculator? A search box in the internet of human knowledge as opposed to a receiver of God's infinite intelligence. The human neurology receives and processes data that is truly infinite.

7- Learn to tell the story of this project:

"Find a way to help everyone..." => Directly ask/receive directions/miracles from God => All man is to do is to bare witness to God and miracles shall never cease.
